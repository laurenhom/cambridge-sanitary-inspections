# Cambridge Sanitary Inspections
Created: March 2024

ETL and EDA process for analyzing sanitary inspection data from Cambridge Open Data. At the time of this project, data from May 12, 2021 to March 19, 2024 with violations ocurring between September 23, 2021 to March 1, 2024.

This project is based on the [Cambridge Open Data Program Civic Innovation Challenge Inventory](https://data.cambridgema.gov/General-Government/Civic-Innovation-Challenge-Inventory/x96z-hdnh/about_data). Data comes from the [Sanitary Inspections dataset](https://data.cambridgema.gov/Inspectional-Services/Sanitary-Inspections/ryb9-qzmw/about_data) and the question to be answered based on the dataset is: 

<blockquote>
How can Cambridge better utilize and present this data to protect public health and safety and improve community access to inspection information?
</blockquote>

Each row in the dataset is an inspection result. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) is in preparation with building a Tableau dashboard to address this question. The project is not intended to ridicule or diminish any particular establishment, but rather to educate the City of Cambridge and its residents.
